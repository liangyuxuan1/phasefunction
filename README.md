# Machine Learning of the Phase Function

Summer-intern project supervised by Prof. [Ge Wang](https://biotech.rpi.edu/centers/bic/people/faculty/ge-wang), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).

Started from May, 2021.

## Objective

Building a phase function model for light propogation in medium using machine learning methods. 

## Background


## Fundamental of light propogation


## Henyey and Greenstein (H-G) phase function 

Reference of H-G function: [HG_Note](https://www.astro.umd.edu/~jph/HG_note.pdf)
