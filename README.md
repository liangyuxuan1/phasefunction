# Machine Learning of the Phase Function

Summer-intern project supervised by Prof. [Ge Wang](https://biotech.rpi.edu/centers/bic/people/faculty/ge-wang), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).

Started from May, 2021.

## Objective

Building a phase function model for light propogation in medium using machine learning methods. 

Prof. Ge Wang: *We can “invert” M-C simulation (which can be CW, frequency-modulated, or time-resolved) to fit the underlying phase function for a homogeneous slab tissue: 1) simulate with HG phase functions with various parameters, and then learn from data so that we have a HG phase function equivalent network model, and 2) in MOSE we perturb the HG phase function and produce simulated data again, and then the network model can fit into the perturbed phase function.*
